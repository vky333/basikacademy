                  <b>Bvoc</b>: A Bachelor of Vocation (BVoc) is an
                  industry-integrated course that trains aspirants to get the
                  skills they need for a job. The differentiating factor would
                  be the way this program is carried out. Unlike any other
                  conventional degree program, students get in-class knowledge
                  that is not very skilled-based and practical. The BVoc program
                  stands out and provides students with real-time training that
                  makes them industry-ready. Moreover, students get trained by
                  experienced industry experts and professionals in the field.
                  Get all the elements such as the value of a BVoc, its scopes,
                  and career opportunities through this article.

              <section>
                <h3>What is the value of BVoc?</h3>
                <p>
                  The first and foremost reason for getting a degree is to get a
                  job. However, most students face this issue where they have no
                  employment. On the other hand, an industry-integrated course
                  such as BVoc enhances employability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now the question is, what is BVoc training all about? It
                  integrates certain job roles and their NOSs (National
                  Occupational Standard) along with broad-based general
                  education. In 2014, the University Grants Commission (UGC)
                  initiated a program for skills development. It was based on
                  higher education as part of college/university education. This
                  opens numerous doors for a Bachelor of Vocation (B.Voc.)
                  Degree i.e. Diploma/Advanced Diploma under the NSQF.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Post completion of a BVoc course the candidates will get the
                  following benefits:-
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Candidates will have an adequate set of skills that make
                    them work-ready.
                  </li>
                  <li>This will enhance their employability.</li>
                  <li>
                    Candidates learn business management concepts and many more.
                  </li>

                <h3>A modern approach to career growth</h3>
                <p>
                  Every year, India adds up to 12 million people to the working
                  population of the country. However, due to a lack of skills
                  and practical knowledge, the workforce of the country is not
                  having a lot of job opportunities. This is also why many
                  industries are unable to find skilled manpower.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To solve this problem, many academies are proposing
                  industry-integrated courses to train the workforce and bridge
                  this gap. As with the emerging trends where the role of
                  technology is increasing with other related factors, job
                  industries are demanding skilled candidates rather than
                  conventional degree holders. One of India’s leading academic
                  institutions and training providers i.e. BASIK Academy has
                  designed employment-friendly programs such as a B-VOC degree
                  in Business Accounting &amp; Taxation to enhance
                  employability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The intervention of the said program would be to focus on
                  quality training in computerized accounting. To also ensure
                  that the aspirants have the relevant skills which make them
                  work- ready right from the beginning of their careers.
